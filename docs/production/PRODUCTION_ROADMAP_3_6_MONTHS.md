## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: Performance issues at scale  
**Mitigation**: Load test before each customer, scale horizontally if needed

**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities discovered  
**Mitigation**: Professional audit in Month 2, rapid patch process

**Risk**: Data loss/corruption  
**Mitigation**: Backup/restore tested in staging, daily backups

### Business Risks
**Risk**: Can't recruit pilot customers  
**Mitigation**: Start outreach in Month 1, offer generous pilot terms

**Risk**: Pilot customers unhappy  
**Mitigation**: Daily check-ins first week, rapid issue resolution

**Risk**: Competition undercuts pricing  
**Mitigation**: Differentiate on performance/support, not price
