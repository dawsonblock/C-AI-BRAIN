## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

A task is considered "Done" when:
- [x] Code is written and reviewed
- [x] All tests pass (100% coverage maintained)
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Changes are committed to git
- [x] Performance impact is measured
- [x] No regressions introduced
- [x] Code is merged to feature branch

## üéì Lessons Learned

### Week 1 Insights
1. **Early Testing Pays Off** - Comprehensive tests caught integration issues early
2. **C++ Standard Compliance** - Careful attention to C++17 vs C++20 features required
3. **Default Constructors** - STL containers have specific requirements for value types
4. **Include Dependencies** - Explicit includes avoid compilation errors

### Best Practices Established
- ‚úÖ Write tests before integration
- ‚úÖ Use modern C++ features appropriately
- ‚úÖ Explicit include directives
- ‚úÖ Template functions over auto parameters (C++17)
- ‚úÖ Default constructors for container value types
- ‚úÖ RAII for all resource management
- ‚úÖ Mutex protection for shared state
